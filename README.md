# Mindustry-Bombing-IA

## How to use the schematic
- To use this schematic copy the content of the file schematic.txt then in game, open the schematics tab, press "import schematic" ant then "import from clipboard".

## Description
This projet's goal is to make the best bombing ai for the rapid gamemode of mindustry.

## Practical info
The code files take the mlog extention but the processors contain only the code copied from each file. The file format is only used for the syntax recognition in the code editor. Each processor contains the code written in one file.

The code is separated in 3 groups of processors :
- The text processors only write the text for the message blocks to prevent it from being changed, and show general info about the schematic's operation.
- The unit processors contain the code to directly control the units.
- The support processors control general info about the schematic's operation like which units are used, and wether to attack or not.
